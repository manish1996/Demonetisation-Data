# Demonetisation-Data
Data Analysis on blood demonetisation data using R

1.The data given in “Demon.csv” presents people’s reaction on demonetisation. The data was collected from the states given in “Residence”. The people’s id was given so as to protect the identity of the individual. The variable “Urban” indicates whether the person is from the urban area of the state (TRUE) or rural area (FALSE). The age and monthly income of the persons included in the study are given in “age” and “monthly.income” respectively. The variable “Demonitisation” indicates the support. If the concerned person supports demonetisation policy then “Yes” is noted otherwise a “No”.
 Given the data set, extract as much information as we can think of from the dataset.

2.Copy only the variable “monthly.income” from the dataset “Demon.csv”. Suppose we denote the monthly income as X and assume that the observations are drawn from a Gamma distribution. 
(a)Find the parameters of the gamma distribution. 
(b)Validate your assumption.
(c)Simulate (simulation size 5000) from the gamma distribution with parameter values same as in (a) and find characteristics of the estimator of 60th percentile.
